# Time Series Analysis of Starbucks Stocks (1992-06-26 to 2023-12-05)

This repository is dedicated to the time series analysis of Starbucks stock prices from June 26, 1992, to December 5, 2023. Time series analysis is a statistical approach for analyzing time-ordered data to uncover patterns, trends, and seasonal variations. It plays a crucial role in forecasting, decision-making, and strategic planning across various domains.

## Importance of Time Series Analysis

* Forecasting: Predict future values based on historical data, essential for finance, economics, and weather prediction.
* Trend Analysis: Identify long-term trends to guide decision-making and strategy.
* Seasonality Detection: Recognize and adjust for seasonal variations, key for inventory and marketing.
* Anomaly Detection: Spot outliers indicating potential issues or extraordinary events.
* Causal Analysis: Understand the impact of time-dependent variables on each other.

## Project Focus: Starbucks Stock Analysis

* Growth Trends: Evaluate Starbucks' stock performance over time, identifying periods of growth or decline.
* Seasonal Patterns: Detect any seasonal fluctuations in stock prices.
* Event Impacts: Assess how specific events have historically influenced stock values.
* Future Forecasting: Utilize historical data to predict future stock price movements.
* Volatility Assessment: Analyze the stock's price volatility for better risk management.

## Objective

This project aims to provide comprehensive insights into Starbucks' stock performance using time series analysis, helping investors and analysts make informed decisions based on historical data patterns.

## Getting Started
# 1. Triple Exponential Smoothing Method for Time Series Forecasting :

Forecasting Starbucks stock prices using the Triple Exponential Smoothing method. The model parameters have been optimized, achieving a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 1.54, indicating a high level of accuracy in predicting stock prices.

## Key Results

* Optimized Parameters:
  * Smoothing Level (α): 0.959
  * Smoothing Trend (β): 2.11e-09
  * Smoothing Seasonal (γ): 5.65e-12
  * Initial Level: 29.41
  * Initial Trend: 0.0066
  * Initial Seasons: nan
  * MAPE Value: 1.54
 
  
* Given these parameters and their implications, the fitted model suggests that the Starbucks stock price series, over the period analyzed, is heavily influenced by the most recent observations with very little weight given to trends or seasonal patterns. This could mean that the stock price is quite volatile, with rapid changes that do not follow a predictable trend or seasonal cycle.

* The MAPE value represents the model's average prediction error of 1.54%, signifying robust predictive capabilities.

## Future Predictions

* Forecast Period: 300 Days

## Disclaimer

Predicting stock prices inherently involves uncertainties, and past performance is not indicative of future results. Make investment decisions responsibly and consider a diverse set of information.
